# dotfiles

These are my personal runtime config files. Ideally, I would be able to install a fresh Linux OS (Ubuntu, Ubuntu on WSL, etc) then run `./setup` and have my workspace exactly how I want it.

## To Do

- Clean up vscode; add to setup
- Add `apt install` for wanted packages such as `git`, `node`, `npm`, `go`, `neofetch`, etc.
- Import personal scripts like `zet`.
- More inspiration from `rwxrob/dot`.

## Thanks

Thank you to [rwxrob](https://www.twitch.tv/rwxrob) for his helpful bashrc and vimrc ideas.
